a binary search tree is a data structure that allows for fast insertion, removal, and lookup of items while offering an efficient way to iterate them in sorted order.

1) if tree  has no element then consider that element as root node
2) if the element is greater than root insert into right subtree
3) if the element is less than root insert into left subtree

 /* Let us create following BST
              50
           /     \
          30      70
         /  \    /  \
        20   40  60   80 */
